# VISPER - Visualization System for Interactions between Proteins and Drugs for Exploratory Research 
Our platform provides an immersive experience for exploring and analyzing a segment of the dataset from [Gon√ßalves et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35839778/). 
With a primary focus on identifying associated proteins and drugs for individual or groups of proteins, VISPER offers comprehensive tools for in-depth research.

This repository contains the code for the **Vi**sualization **S**ystem for Interactions between **P**roteins and Drugs for **E**xploratory **R**esearch(**VISPER**).
To use VISPER locally on your PC, we recommend using the Docker version of VISPER. For detailed instructions, see the [Docker installation instructions](#docker).

If you would like to access the code, please contact the authors at daniel.dehncke@tu-braunschweig.de.

### Docker
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Optional: Restart your pc after the installation
3. Download the [docker-compose.yml from the docker folder](./docker/docker-compose.yml) of this repository. Important: Do not use the wrong docker-compose file!
4. Open the terminal in the folder where you placed the docker-compose.yml and run the following command:
```
docker-compose up
```
(Optional: First run docker-compose pull)
This process can take some time (approximately 40 minutes).
5. Call http://localhost:7474/browser/ and execute the following Neo4j cipher (user: neo4j, password: workwork).
```
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Drug) ON (d.name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Protein) ON (p.name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Cell_Line) ON (c.name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Drug) ON (d.uid);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Protein) ON (p.uid);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Cell_Line) ON (c.uid);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Drug) ON (d.drug_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Drug) ON (d.CHEMBL);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Cell_Line) ON (c.COSMIC_ID);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Protein) ON (p.swiss);
CALL gds.graph.project("graph", "Protein", {PPI: {orientation: "UNDIRECTED"}});
```
6. The website should be running on http://localhost:3000/
